Each test computes a p-value to determine randomness: if p-value â‰¤ 0.05, the number is considered non-random; otherwise, it is considered random. Now, analyze this document and perform the following tasks: Explain the purpose of each test and what it measures, summarize the results of each test and assess whether they indicate randomness, identify any patterns or biases in the test outcomes, analyze graphs (if present) and extract key insights, and provide a final conclusion on the overall quality of randomness and whether the numbers meet statistical randomness criteria. Also generates a single table which consists of all the tests and their result yes or no.Extract the graphs persent in the report and send it graph to for better analysis."
